Revision history for Perl extension Shell::Perl.

0.0011  Jun 21, 2007 [worked around Mar 15, 2007]
        - some minor improvements to Makefile.PL - conformance
          to META.yml specification
        - when dumping YAML, prefer YAML::Syck to YAML if available
        - we have a bug to fix: the REPL and the running interpreter
          share global state (like $_) and so relying on these
          between lines is not nice (to say the least)

        - this is a read-eval-print loop and not a
          read-eval-loop, doh
        - total rewrite for the implementation of dumpers
        - new output style with the plain dumper (idea
          borrowed from Sepia by Sean O'Rourke)
        - Data::Dump, Data::Dumper, YAML are only required
          at runtime and fail gracefully if not there
        - the preferred dumper is via Data::Dump, but it
          falls back to Data::Dumper, YAML and the plain
          dumper according to availability
        - fix bug: inline contexts (like #scalar)
          were not being respected for printing
        - Makefile.PL required ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.31 
          and we are more tolerant now (thanks, Lorn)
        - now the right line number is used at
          warnings and errors (Lorn again)
