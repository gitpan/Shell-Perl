- pirl now accepts switches --version and -v
- added IPC::Cmd and Test::Deep as prerequisites

Date=2007-06-21T12:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- some minor improvements to Makefile.PL - conformance
to META.yml specification
- when dumping YAML, prefer YAML::Syck to YAML if available
- we have a bug to fix: the REPL and the running interpreter
share global state (like $_) and so relying on these
between lines is not nice (to say the least)
EOT

[V 0.0010]
Date=2007-03-14T12:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- this is a read-eval-print loop and not a
read-eval-loop, doh
- total rewrite for the implementation of dumpers
- new output style with the plain dumper (idea
borrowed from Sepia by Sean O'Rourke)
- Data::Dump, Data::Dumper, YAML are only required
at runtime and fail gracefully if not there
- the preferred dumper is via Data::Dump, but it
falls back to Data::Dumper, YAML and the plain
dumper according to availability
- fix bug: inline contexts (like #scalar)
were not being respected for printing
- Makefile.PL required ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.31
and we are more tolerant now (thanks, Lorn)
- now the right line number is used at
warnings and errors (Lorn again)
